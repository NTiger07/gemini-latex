# AI-Based Image-to-LaTeX System

The AI-Based Image-to-LaTeX System is a backend application built with Express.js that converts mathematical expressions in images into LaTeX code. It uses the Google Gemini API for AI-driven OCR and LaTeX generation. The system supports up to five image uploads at once via Multer.js, and efficiently processes files using Node.js fs module. Error handling and validation are implemented to manage API failures and file issues.
